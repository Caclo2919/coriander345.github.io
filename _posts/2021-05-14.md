### HTML and CSS

**HTML** is like a bone and **css** is like skin 
these two element compose basic of web page 
and **javascript** make it more vivid. 
 ``` html
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hi this is HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1></h1>
    <h2></h2>
</body>
</html>
 ```

 ```css
 h1 {
    font-family: Helvetica;
    font-size: 100px;
    color: khaki;
    }

#id {
    font-weight: bold;
    text-align: left;
    background-color: mediumspringgreen;
}
.class {
    background-color: lightcoral;
}
 ```

 aaaaaaaa\
 aaaaaaa\
 aaaaaa\
 aaaaa\
